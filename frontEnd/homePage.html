					<h1>We package and ship the cigars</h1>
					<p>Each cigar is tediously inspected under our quality control <br> division to ensure the best quality or nothing at all.</p>
					<p>Storing cigars in the seasoning rooms, the cigars are in either <br>cedar bins, cedar drawers, or cedar shelves. The temperature and <br>humidity conditions are kept at an ideal level for the cigars to be stored <br>for three weeks to a year. The longer the cigars remain in the seasoning<br> room, the better they will be.</p>
					<p>Every cigar box is transported in climate controlled trucks</p>
